# PSIO_Project
--This is a turn-based game made in Java using .swing libraries and a lot of sweat and tears.--

Strategize and plan your moves to defeat as many enemies as you can. Use collectibles and weapons to increase your chances of survival. Excercise your mind by solving in-game puzzles and thus avoid risking your life and limb by challenging dangerous foes.

The following have lost sleep over this monstrosity:
- Piotrek - project manager, generator of generators
- Jedrek - puzzles and GUI expert
- Max - gameplay developer, combat expert (literally)
- Maciek - technical developer, clean code master
- Vlad - content creator, the riddler
- Ania - just trying to hold it all together
